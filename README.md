## Introduction
This project uses machine learning techniques, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease or not. It aims to provide a valuable tool for early diagnosis and intervention in heart disease cases.

## Features
- Input features include various medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more.
- Uses a deep learning ANN model to classify heart disease.
- Provides prediction probabilities and classification results.
